This Looper is designed for Android mobile phones. It records a first loop Loop1 and a second Loop2 on top of it. 
You record clicking on the bottons of the first column. You can record as many layers as you want on the second. 
The bottons of the second column play/mute the loops. Finally the bang of the third column: 
the top one bangs the whole loop, the second one clears the the second loop.
